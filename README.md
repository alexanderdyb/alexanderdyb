## About me

Hello there, my name is Alexander and I am a consultant who specializes in marketing, CRM and web development. In addition to my consulting work, I am currently studying frontend development to expand my skill set and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends.

I am fortunate to call the picturesque coastal town of Ã…lesund in Norway my home, where I enjoy the breathtaking views and outdoor activities the region has to offer. In my free time, I like to work out, travel, and try out new restaurants.

Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me.
